# Related configuration of MinIO/S3/GCS or any other service supports S3 API, which is responsible for data persistence for Woodpecker.
# We refer to the storage service as MinIO/S3 in the following description for simplicity.
minio:
  # IP address of MinIO or S3 service.
  # Environment variable: MINIO_ADDRESS
  # minio.address and minio.port together generate the valid access to MinIO or S3 service.
  # MinIO preferentially acquires the valid IP address from the environment variable MINIO_ADDRESS when Woodpecker is started.
  # Default value applies when MinIO or S3 is running on the same network with Woodpecker.
  address: localhost
  port: 9000 # Port of MinIO or S3 service.
  # Access key ID that MinIO or S3 issues to user for authorized access.
  # Environment variable: MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID or minio.accessKeyID
  # minio.accessKeyID and minio.secretAccessKey together are used for identity authentication to access the MinIO or S3 service.
  # This configuration must be set identical to the environment variable MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID, which is necessary for starting MinIO or S3.
  # The default value applies to MinIO or S3 service that started with the default docker-compose.yml file.
  accessKeyID: minioadmin
  # Secret key used to encrypt the signature string and verify the signature string on server. It must be kept strictly confidential and accessible only to the MinIO or S3 server and users.
  # Environment variable: MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or minio.secretAccessKey
  # minio.accessKeyID and minio.secretAccessKey together are used for identity authentication to access the MinIO or S3 service.
  # This configuration must be set identical to the environment variable MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, which is necessary for starting MinIO or S3.
  # The default value applies to MinIO or S3 service that started with the default docker-compose.yml file.
  secretAccessKey: minioadmin

  # Name of the bucket where Woodpecker stores data in MinIO or S3.
  # Woodpecker does not support storing data in multiple buckets.
  # Bucket with this name will be created if it does not exist. If the bucket already exists and is accessible, it will be used directly. Otherwise, there will be an error.
  # To share an MinIO instance among multiple Woodpecker instances, consider changing this to a different value for each Woodpecker instance before you start them.
  # The data will be stored in the local Docker if Docker is used to start the MinIO service locally. Ensure that there is sufficient storage space.
  # A bucket name is globally unique in one MinIO or S3 instance.
